Subject: [PATCH 3/3] ws2_32: Use STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED to indicate that the AcceptEx async is incomplete (try 3).

Real Name:
    Erich Hoover

Description:
    This patch changes the way AcceptEx handles completions so that
canceled sockets can still send completion notifications.  The patch
fixes a significant issue with the WoW launcher and the Diablo 3
installer (Bug #28898).

Changelog:
    ws2_32: Use STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED to indicate that the
AcceptEx async is incomplete.
